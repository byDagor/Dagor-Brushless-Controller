# **Dagor Brushless Controller**

The *Dagor Controller* is an Open Source fully integrated tiny solution for brushless-based actuators with wireless capabilities and three operation modes: angular position, velocity and torque. It is an ESP32-based brushless controller that has an on-board magnetic angular position sensor, a three-phase MOSFET driver, three MOSFET half-bridges, a temperature sensor and current sensing resistors.

| Note: The project is currently on it's Alpha stage and with the help of the Alpha testers the project will move forward faster. |

## What makes this Controller different?

The *Dagor Brushless Controller* was designed as a simple platform for hobbyist and students to power brushless-based projects. This board offers wired and wireless connectivity modes to accommodate a variety of different kinds of projects. The firmware for this board was developed for the Arduino development environment and powered by the [SimpleFOC project](https://www.simplefoc.com/). This code is merely a starting point as it's encouraged to modify it to fit specific projects. The [firmware](firmware) being very easy to modify and understand gives some key advantages:
- great platform for single board projects
- custom communication schemes for multi-board projects
- implementation of unique control laws
- endless amount of compatible libraries
