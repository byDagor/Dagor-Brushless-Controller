# Power stage

The board's power stage consist of three N-channel MOSFET half-bridges (Q1 - Q6) and a DRV8305 pre-driver (U1). The power stage can be described as the components necessary to deliver the power to drive a brushless motor according to the logic from the logic stage. The area marked in red shows the power stage in the *Dagor Controller - Alpha*.

The DRV8305 is a three-phase gate driver that can drive high and low-side N-channel MOSFETs. What makes this driver special is the amount of programmable parameters, the protection features and the fault diagnostics; all of which take place through an SPI bus.
The driver has two types of faults: *warning* and *fault*. If either occur the red indicator LED on the **Dagor** board will turn on; if a *fault* occurs the MOSFETs will be placed in their high impedance state, if a *warning* occurs operation will continue normally.
A few of the faults that the driver reports are the following: high temperature flags, source under or over-voltage, VDS over current monitors, gate drive fault, etc. Please refer to the  [DRV8305 datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv8305.pdf?ts=1593641896221&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F) if you want to learn more about all the features of this driver IC.
The picture below shows the simplified schematic of the whole power stage (driver +  MOSFETs).
