# Dagor Brushless Controller

The Dagor Controller is a fully integrated tiny solution for brushless-based actuators with wireless capabilities and three operation modes: angular position, velocity and torque. It is an ESP32-based brushless controller that has an on-board magnetic encoder, a three-phase MOSFET driver, three MOSFET half-bridges, a temperature sensor and current sensing resistors.

## What makes this Controller different?
The *Dagor Brushless Controller* was designed as a simple platform for hobbyist and students to power brushless-based projects. This board offers wired and wireless connectivity modes to accommodate a variety of different kinds of projects. The firmware for this board was developed for the Arduino development environment and powered by the [SimpleFOC project](simplefoc.com). This code is merely a starting point as it’s encouraged to modify it to fit specific projects. The firmware being very easy to modify and understand gives some key advantages:

- great platform for single board projects
- custom communication schemes for multi-board projects
- implementation of unique control laws
- endless amount of compatible libraries

## HW Revisions
| Reivision    | Changes          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 2.7 | Solid GND plane, input TVS diode. |
| 2.6 | Rearrenged the LEDs to avoid bleed, added extra bulk capacitance to the back. |
